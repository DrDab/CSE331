Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder, and why you made those changes.

- made graph class spec require immutable nodes and edges as getter methods returning generics can
  cause a risk of representation exposure if the generics are mutable.

other than that I made no other changes to my graph class or test code.
