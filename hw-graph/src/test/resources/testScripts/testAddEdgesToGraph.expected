created graph g

added node ALPHA to g
added node BRAVO to g
added node CHARLIE to g

# All nodes should have no children yet, as there are no edges.
the children of ALPHA in g are:
the children of BRAVO in g are:
the children of CHARLIE in g are:

# Add edge "ab1" from nodes ALPHA to BRAVO
added edge ab1 from ALPHA to BRAVO in g

# Check ALPHA has path "ab1" to BRAVO but not vice-versa (as the graph is directed).
the children of ALPHA in g are: BRAVO(ab1)
the children of BRAVO in g are:

# Add edge "ab2" from nodes ALPHA to BRAVO
added edge ab2 from ALPHA to BRAVO in g

# Check ALPHA now has paths "ab1", "ab2" to BRAVO but not vice-versa (as the graph is directed).

the children of BRAVO in g are:

# Add edge "ab3" from nodes ALPHA to BRAVO
added edge ab3 from ALPHA to BRAVO in g

the children of BRAVO in g are:

# Add edge "ba1" from nodes BRAVO to ALPHA
added edge ba1 from BRAVO to ALPHA in g
